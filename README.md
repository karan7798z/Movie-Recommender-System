# Movie-Recommender-System
This is a movie recommendation system based on Content-Based and Collaborative-Filtering approaches for recommendations

In this project I have used 2 widely adopted approaches of building recommender systems, to recommend movies to users.

The 2 widely used approaches are -

### 1. Content Based Recommenders -
In this, recommendations are provided to users on basis of their profile, which revolves around their preferences and tastes.

### 2. Collaborative Filtering -
In this, user is matched to similar users (based on preferences), and then recommends items that the similar users have liked against the provided input. Basically in this, users are matched and there is no need to extract information from the recommended item unlike content-based filters.
