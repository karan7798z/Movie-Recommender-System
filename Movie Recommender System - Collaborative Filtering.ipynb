Content Based Recommenders -\nIn this, recommendations are provided to users on basis of their profile, which revolves around their preferences and tastes.\n\n#### 2. Collaborative Filtering -\nIn this, user is matched to similar users (based on preferences), and then recommends items that the similar users have liked against the provided input. Basically in this, users are matched and there is no need to extract information from the recommended item unlike content-based filters."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Collaborative Filtering\n\nCollaborative Filtering is also known asn User-User filtering because in this technique, we try finding similar users. There are 2 popular approaches for collaborative filtering -\n\n1. User Based Collaborative Filtering - Which is based on similarity of users (i.e. their preferences). Here we have an active user for whom the recommendation is aimed. The engine will first look for users who are similar i.e. users who share the active users rating patterns, preferences etc. \n\n2. Item Based Collaborative Filtering - Which is based on finding similarity among items and building neighbourhood of items i.e. if a user liked one item, he/she might also like the neighbouring item. The criteria of building neighbourhood of items is not their content, but their recommendation sources, i.e. the users.\n\nHere, we will be using the User Based collaborative filtering, by utilizing the ratings dataset available with us."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"So stepwise the process is listed below:\n\n#### 1.
